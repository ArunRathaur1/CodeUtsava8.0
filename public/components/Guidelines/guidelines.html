            <ol>
                <li>All <span class="span">team members</span > should be from the same college; <span class="span">no inter-college</span> teams are allowed. However, members from <span class="span">different branches</span> of the same college/institute are encouraged to form a team.</li>
                <li>Each team would comprise <span class="span">2-4 members</span>, including the <span class="span">team leader</span>.</li>
                <li>As the <span class="span">software edition</span> of the hackathon is a digital product development competition, the majority of the team members must be well versed with <span class="span">programming skills</span >. For the <span class="span">hardware edition</span >, we encourage multidisciplinary teams â€“ which means your team should have a good mix of Mechanical Engineers, Electronics Engineers, Product Designers and Programmers, etc.</li>
            </ol>
